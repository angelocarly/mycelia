# Mycelia
Graph renderer and playground.

## Goals
Mycelia is intended as the base for [mindspace](https://github.com/angelocarly/mindspace). A relational knowledge
database.

Its planned features are:
- Graph rendering and modification
- Local graph editing
- More fun algorithms visualization tools

These might in-turn be used for the knowledge database.
